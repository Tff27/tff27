### About Me
Hi Iâ€™m Tiago, a software engineer from Portugal. 
I have started coding when I was about 15 years old at school.

Since then I've worked with manly with .Net, from web forms to the latest thing there is at .net stack.
Over the past years I've design, developed and deploy many projects using different technologies.

I believe in continuous learning and that there is always something that we can make better.
