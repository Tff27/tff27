### Hi there 👋

### About Me
Hey, I’m **Tiago Fonseca**, a software engineer from Portugal.

I started coding when I was about 15 years old at school.
Since then, I've mainly worked with .NET, from web forms to the latest additions to the .NET stack.
Over the past years, I've **designed, developed, and deployed** various projects using different technologies.
Also, those were developed for multiple sectors, such as education, e-commerce, and most recently fintechs.

I'm a believer in continuous learning and that there is always something we can improve.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: **Blazor, Web3, AWS**
