### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
Hey Iâ€™m **Tiago Fonseca**, a software engineer from Portugal.

I started coding when I was about 15 years old at school.
Since then, I've mainly worked with .net, from web forms to the latest additions to the .net stack.
Over the past years, I've **designed, developed, and deployed** various projects using different technologies.

I'm a believer in continuous learning and that there is always something that we can make better.
